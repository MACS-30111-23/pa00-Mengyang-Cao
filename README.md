## Git/GitHub Workflow and Markdown

1. Created a new repository on GitHub.
2. Cloned the repository to my local computer for editing.
3. Created the README file and added content using Markdown.
4. Pushed changes to the GitHub repository to update it.

Working with Markdown is great. I learned how to use various formatting techniques to enhance the readability of my documentation. This has significantly improved my ability to document my work and share it effectively. It's easy to insert a picture as long as I put the picture into my repository.
